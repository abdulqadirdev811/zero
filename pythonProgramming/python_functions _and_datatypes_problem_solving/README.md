**Description :** we are given a some meeting times. We need to find a way to identify the number of meeting rooms needed to schedule them all. Each meeting will contain positive integers for a startTime and an endTime.

Our meeting times can be listed as follows: {{2, 8}, {3, 4}, {3, 9}, {5, 11}, {8, 20}, {11, 15}}. We could schedule each meeting in a separate room, but we want to use the minimum amount of rooms. We observe that three meetings overlap: {2, 8}, {3, 4}, and {3, 9}. Therefore, at least these three will require separate rooms.

**TASK**: Task: Your goal is to create a functionality for scheduling meetings. You need to determine and block the minimum number of meeting rooms for these meetings.
